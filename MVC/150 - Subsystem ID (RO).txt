15:0 - Subsystem ID (RO)
This field, along with the Subsystem Vendor ID field, are used to distinguish cards from different manufacturers even though they may be using the same PCI or PCIe controller (and thus have the same VendorID and DeviceID). A value of zero in these registers indicates there isn't a Subsystem Vendor ID and Subsystem ID associated with the function.
The full name of this register is really "Subsystem Device ID", but the "device" is silent.
