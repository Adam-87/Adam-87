7:0 - Capabilities Pointer (RO)
If the Capabilities List bit in the Status register is set to one, the function implements the Capabilities Pointer register. This pointer contains the DWORD-aligned start address of the Capabilities List within this function's PCI-compatible configuration space. It is a rule that the two least-significant bits must be hardwired to zero and must be ignored (i.e., masked) by software when reading the register. The upper six bits represents the upper six bits of the 8-bit start address of the first PCI-compatible capability structure in the linked list of structures. Each capability structure has a pointer to the next structure in the list. Software knows when it has reached the last structure in the linked list because the pointer field is 00h. It should be noted that the linked list of capability structures started with this register only contains capability structures in the PCI-compatible space (first 256 bytes of config space). The linked list of capability structures that live in the extended configuration space (beyond 256 bytes) begins with the first structure located at offset 100h (256 decimal).
