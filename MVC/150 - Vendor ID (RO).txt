15:0 - Vendor ID (RO)
This 16-bit register identifies the manufacturer of the function. The value hardwired in this read-only register is assigned by a central authority (the PCI SIG) that controls issuance of the numbers. The value FFFFh is reserved and must be returned by the Host/PCI bridge when an attempt is made to perform a configuration read from a configuration register in a non-existent function.
